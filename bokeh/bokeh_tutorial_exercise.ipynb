    "There are several good reasons to use bokeh, first it provides a rich API, meaning that there are many visualizations \n",
    "types supported and it exposes a lot attributes to the user to customize the visualization without becoming \"low level\". Furthermore it can be called directly from python but provides visualizations for the web. This means on one hand that you don't have to switch to another web framework to bring your interactive visualizations to the public, on the otherhand this allows you to program the complete data visualization process simply in python. \n",

    "We will start off with the very basics, how to create a bokeh plot, how to link multiple plots, how to handle categorical data with the framework. Later, we will look at the bokeh server, which allows you to handle interactions of the user and compute stuff on some event raised by the user.\n",

    "## 5. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, the visualizations have been fairly static. However, since this is an *interactive* visualization course, of course we want to look at Bokehs features in that regard. Take a look at the following example. As you can see, additionally to the figure conveying the temperature, an additional slider is provided to filter the signal. Such functionality is very typical in visualization tasks, because data signals tend to be noisy and hard to read without the approiate tools given to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bokeh does this by employing a server-client architecture. You visualization thus contains two parts, the client is the visualization in browser, whenever the user interacts with the visualization by *selecting*, *clicking* or *changing* something, the server is informed and a callback allows you to define what to do with the callback. In the example below, whenever the value of the slider changes, `callback` gets called on the server, and the data is updated with a filtered one according to the slider value.\n",
